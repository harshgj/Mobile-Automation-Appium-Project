# Mobile-Automation-Appium-Project
Mobile-Automation-Appium-Project is a BDD based mobile automation framework. It is built using the tools like Appium, Cucumber, Maven, Junit.
This framework is basically designed to run mobile automation tests for 3 different platforms i.e Android, iOS, & UWP(windows). We have also taken care of videos, screenshots and reporting in this framework.

We have put in the comments everywhere in the framework where ever required. So in that way it is self explanatory. Just clone it and you are good to go for designing your scripts on all 3 platforms.

Soon we will be also integrating the Azure yaml file with this framework which is required to run your tests on Azure Pipelines.
